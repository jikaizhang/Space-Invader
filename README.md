# Space-Invader

This is a classic game. Your goal is to attack as much ufos as possible, as well as not getting attacked.

Press direction keys to control direction, press Space key to shoot. You can only shoot if your bullet disappeared from the frame or attacked an enemy.

Each time you hit an enemy, the enemy will revive at a random location on the top part of the frame.

In each game you have 5 lives. There are 2 ways to lose the game: your live is 0 or one enemy ufo reach the bottom of the frame.

Every time you get 10 points, your lives go back to 5, and there will be one more enemy, until there are already 5 enemies.

A trick to play this game is: never let the enemy get too close to you.

Have Fun!
